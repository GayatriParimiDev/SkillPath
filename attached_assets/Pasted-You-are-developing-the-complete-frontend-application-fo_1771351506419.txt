You are developing the complete frontend application for an AI-powered personalized learning platform named SkillPath.

⚠️ IMPORTANT CONTEXT

The backend is already fully developed.

DO NOT recreate backend logic.
DO NOT duplicate API logic.
DO NOT modify backend structure.

Only build the frontend.

Connect all frontend components to the existing backend APIs.

🎯 UPDATED PROJECT GOAL

Develop a fully animated, modern, minimal, mobile-first frontend application that connects seamlessly with the existing backend.

The UI must be:

• Minimal and elegant
• Modern SaaS design
• Student-friendly
• Soft gradient theme
• Fully animated
• Mobile-first and responsive
• Hackathon demo ready
• Include Light/Dark theme toggle

The application should feel like a real startup product.

🛠 FRONTEND TECHNOLOGY STACK

Use:

• React.js (Vite)
• Tailwind CSS
• Framer Motion (animations)
• Recharts (charts)
• Axios (API calls)
• React Router (navigation)
• Context API (auth + theme state management)

🔗 BACKEND API ENDPOINTS

Authentication:
POST /api/signup
POST /api/login

Student Features:
GET /api/roadmap/:student_id
POST /api/concept
POST /api/feedback
POST /api/integrity
POST /api/progress
GET /api/analytics/:student_id

Use real API calls.
No mock data.

👤 AUTHENTICATION MODES

The system must support:

1️⃣ Login

Uses:
POST /api/login

Store:
token
student_id

Save in localStorage.

Protect dashboard routes.

2️⃣ Signup

Uses:
POST /api/signup

Store token + student_id
Redirect to dashboard.

3️⃣ Guest User Mode (NEW REQUIREMENT)

Because the backend database currently does not allow inserting new user records:

• Add a “Continue as Guest” button on the Login page.
• Guest mode must NOT create any database record.
• Do NOT call /api/signup for guest.
• Do NOT store guest in DB.

Guest user behavior:

• Generate a temporary guest_id (UUID on frontend).
• Store it in localStorage.
• Allow access to all dashboard pages.
• For API calls requiring student_id:
- Send guest_id as student_id.
- Backend may return analysis-only data.
• If backend rejects student_id:
- Gracefully fallback to frontend temporary state.

Guest users should be able to:

• Enter curriculum details manually.
• Upload learning preferences.
• Generate roadmap.
• Use concept coach.
• Use feedback analysis.
• Track temporary progress (stored in localStorage only).

Guest progress must persist only in browser storage.

📚 CURRICULUM ANALYSIS FLOW (NEW REQUIREMENT)

In Guest Mode:

Create a Curriculum Analysis onboarding step:

Step 1:
Ask:
• Education level
• Current subjects
• Strength areas
• Weak areas
• Goal (exam / placement / skill)

Step 2:
Send data to:
POST /api/concept or relevant analysis endpoint

Step 3:
Generate:

• Personalized 4-week roadmap
• Strength/weakness summary
• Confidence score
• Suggested learning path

Display this beautifully with animations.

This should feel like an AI analyzing the student in real time.

🎨 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (UPDATED)

Overall Theme:

• Minimal UI
• Soft blue + purple gradient background
• Clean whitespace
• Subtle glassmorphism cards
• No clutter
• Soft shadows
• Floating animated gradient blobs

🌗 DARK MODE TOGGLE (NEW REQUIREMENT)

Add theme toggle switch in navbar:

• Light mode (default)
• Dark mode

Use Tailwind dark mode strategy.

Dark theme:

• Deep navy/black background
• Subtle purple glow
• Soft neon highlights
• Accessible contrast

Theme must persist in localStorage.

Animate theme transition smoothly.
